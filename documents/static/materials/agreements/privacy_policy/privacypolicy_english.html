【Notification of a Revision to the Privacy Policy on December 1, 2021】<br />
The processing numbers required when a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 registers the result of his/her positive test in the contact confirmation application (hereinafter “the App”) have not been retained in the data after the positive registration or after the end of the expiration date previously. However, we have now changed this and shall retain processing numbers as data in the cloud of the management system that issues processing numbers to respond to inquiries. Accordingly, we have revised the privacy policy in line with this.<br />
<br />
【Notification of a Revision to the Privacy Policy on December 15, 2020】<br />
The App has until now employed a system that notifies users who may have been in contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 over the past 14 days when a user registers that he/she has tested positive. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has now revised this from the perspective of ensuring consistency with the proactive epidemiological investigations conducted by health care centers. Therefore, we have started distributing a revised version of the App. In this version, a user who has tested positive for COVID-19 inputs the date of the onset of symptoms or the test date. The application then notifies users who may have been in contact with the said user who has tested positive for COVID-19 from approximately two days before that onward (within the infectable period). Accordingly, we have revised the privacy policy in line with this. The main changes are as follows.<br />
<ul>
    <li>We have stated that there is a system which notifies users that they may have been in contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 within the infectable period as the system of the App. We have stated that this system works by the person who has tested positive for COVID-19 inputting the date of the onset of symptoms or the test date in addition to the processing number and then sending the daily key generated from approximately two days before that onward (within the infectable period) to the notification server.
　　<li>We have specified that this only applies to the daily key generated within the infectable period in the information obtained by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare using the App.
　　<li>We have specified that the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare will not obtain or provide to other application users the date of the onset of symptoms or the test date input in the App.
</ul>　　　
<br />

〇 Contact Confirmation Application Privacy Policy<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations, and giving maximum consideration to users&rsquo; privacy, in the provision of the App. To that end, the App is provided in accordance with the following Privacy Policy.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
